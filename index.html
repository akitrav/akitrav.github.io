                        The "Game of Dice" is a multiplayer game where N players roll a 6 faced dice in a round-robin fashion. Each time a player rolls the dice their points increase by the number (1 to 6) achieved by the roll.

                        As soon as a player accumulates M points they complete the game and are assigned a rank. Remaining players continue to play the game till they accumulate at least M points. The game ends when all players have accumulated at least M points.
